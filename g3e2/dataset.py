"""
G3E-2 dataset — turns prepare_g3e2.py's flat JSONL records into the
multimodal conversation format Qwen2.5-VL's `AutoProcessor` expects.

Per spec section 14: the image is supplied through the processor's proper
multimodal content block (`{"type": "image", "image": <PIL.Image>}`), never
as a filename string typed into the prompt text. This module is the one
place that distinction is enforced — prepare_g3e2.py deliberately stays
plain-JSON/no-torch so it's testable without a GPU; this file is where
`torch`/`transformers` actually get imported.

Target format (spec section 15): the assistant turn is REQUIRED to be
strict JSON matching `shared.schemas.G3E2Output` — no "Sure! Based on the
image..." preamble. `SYSTEM_PROMPT` below states this explicitly.

CANONICAL SOURCE: `SYSTEM_PROMPT` and `build_user_prompt` are defined here
and imported by `g3e2/reasoner.py` (inference) — don't redefine them a
second time there or anywhere else; training and inference must use
byte-identical prompts, or the model sees a different prompt at inference
than it was trained on.

    Thin, framework-agnostic wrapper around a prepare_g3e2.py JSONL file.
    Implements the plain Python sequence protocol (`__len__`/`__getitem__`)

    subclassing it here — avoids a hard torch import for anything that
    only needs to iterate records (tests, `scripts/validate_dataset.py`).

    Real training code wraps this with a torch Dataset subclass (or just
    subclasses this one directly, adding `torch` as a dependency at that
    point) that also calls the Qwen `AutoProcessor` in `__getitem__` to
    produce actual model inputs — that final tokenization step is left out
    of this file on purpose, since it depends on the exact processor
    version/API and is the one part of this pipeline that genuinely needs
    a real Qwen2.5-VL install to exercise.
